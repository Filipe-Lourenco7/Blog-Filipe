            Hello, my name is Filipe LourenÃ§o, I am 19 years old, and I plan to build my career in Information Technology until retirement (if I make it there! ðŸ˜†).  
            I currently live in Itaquaquecetuba and work in IT support at Almeida Metais. I am studying Systems Analysis and Development and plan to pursue another degree in the area in the future. My main goal is to join a large tech company, where I can work on innovative projects and continue growing professionally.  
            Since I was young, I have been passionate about technology, which led me to choose IT as my career. I also learn quickly, which has helped me acquire new skills and constantly evolve.  
            From the beginning of my journey, I have invested in my education with various courses, including English, computer science, business management, digital career, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and technical drawing. I am also self-taught and have gained knowledge in technologies such as Power BI, SolidWorks (3D modeling software), Inventor, Canva, Figma, SQL, PostgreSQL, and, of course, the Microsoft Office suite.  
            Currently, I am studying Java at university and improving my skills on Coursera, focusing on building a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, HTML5, and GitHub. Once I finish my Front-end studies, I will start deepening my knowledge in Java, Python, C#, and other languages.  
            My goal is to become a well-rounded professional capable of working in various areas of technology, with an emphasis on Full-Stack development. I study both Back-end and Front-end, always striving to evolve and prepare for market challenges. I want to join large companies where I can contribute my knowledge and continue growing in the tech field.  
            If you want to follow my progress and see the projects I have developed, I created a <a id="link_aba" href="projeto.html">special section</a> on my blog where I share everything I have been building!

            I have extensive experience in the metallurgy field, as I have worked in the coordination of a department where I developed technical drawings, work instructions, 3D modeling, various Excel spreadsheets, supplier management, and more.  
            Currently, I work at Almeida Metais, assisting users with Datasul and other software in general. I previously worked for 3 years at Compromesso, and in 2025 I joined Almeida Metais!
